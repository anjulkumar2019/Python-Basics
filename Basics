Basic Datatypes 
  Integers (default for numbers) 
    z = 5 / 2 # Answer is 2, integer division. 
  Floats 
    x = 3.456 
  Strings
    a="Anjul Kumar"
  we can use "" or '' to specify. “abc” ‘abc’ (Same thing.) 
  Use triple double-quotes for multi-line strings or strings than contain both ‘ and “ inside of them: “““a‘b“c””” 

Whitespace are meaningful in Python: especially indentation and placement of newlines. 

Comments 
  Start comments with # – the rest of line is ignored. 
  Can include a “documentation string” as the first line of any new function or class that you define. 
  The development environment, debugger, and other tools use it: it’s good style to include one. 

def my_function(x, y): 
“““This is the docstring. This function does blah blah blah.””” 
# The code would go here... 


Naming Rules 
Names are case sensitive and cannot start with a number. They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. 
  For Example: bob Bob _bob _2_bob_ bob_2 BoB 
There are some reserved words: 
  and, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, exec, finally, for, from, global, 
  if, import, in, is, lambda, not, or, pass, print, raise, return, try, and while 
  
Sequence Types 
1. Tuple 
  a. A simple immutable ordered sequence of items 
  b. Items can be of mixed types, including collection types 

2. Strings 
  a. Immutable 
  b. Conceptually very much like a tuple 

3. List 
  a. Mutable ordered sequence of items of mixed types 




Program 1.
          x = 34 - 23 
          y = "Hello"
          z = 3.45 
          if z == 3.45 or y == "Hello": 
              x = x + 1 
              y = y + " World"
          print(x) 
          print(y) 

 x,y, and z are integer, string, and float variables 
 Output: 12 
         Hello World

Explanation:
Assignment uses = and comparison uses ==. 
For numbers + - * / % are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. 
Special use of + for string concatenation. 
Logical operators are words (and, or, not) not symbols 
The basic printing command is print. 
The first assignment to a variable creates it. 
Variable types don’t need to be declared. 
Python figures out the variable types on its own.
